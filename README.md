CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) is a numerical tool for solving the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations and for computing the cosmological observables for a given input model. CLASS is a flexible and user-friendly code that can be easily generalized to non-minimal cosmological models. CLASS was written by Julien Lesgourgues & Thomas Tram, and first released in 2011. CLASS is written in C language for each module. It comes with C++ and Python wrapper.
