CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) is a numerical tool for solving the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations and for computing the cosmological observables for a given input model. CLASS is a flexible and user-friendly code that can be easily generalized to non-minimal cosmological models. CLASS was written by Julien Lesgourgues & Thomas Tram, and first released in 2011. CLASS is written in C language for each module. It comes with C++ and Python wrapper. 

For more information about CLASS can be found on the website: [http://class-code.net](http://class-code.net). The CLASS papers can be found below

CLASS Installation 
==================
### 1. Pre-requisites
- Mac Users
  Mac users may have to install the Command Line Tools for Xcode in order
to use the commands like `gcc`, `git` or `make` or package management tools like
Homebrew. You can check if the Command Line Tools have already installed
to your system or not by open the terminal and run
  ```Linux
  xcode-select -p
  ```
  If they are already installed, it should return a path like /Library/Develop-
er/CommandLineTools. If not, you can install them manually by running the
following command
  ```Linux
  xcode-select --install
  ```
  Alternatively you can download the Command Line Tools by going to the site:
  [https://developer.apple.com/download/all/](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) (sign in is required), click download
  Command Line Tools for XCode. \
  Next step, you need to install Homebrew in the system. Homebrew can be
  downloaded it by typing this command on the terminal
  ```Linux
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
  After that, you will need to install a C-language compiler such as `GCC` (Gnu
  Compiler Collection), which is commonly used as a compiler with support for
  `C`, `C++`, `Fortran`, etc. `GCC` can be installed by compiling.
  ```Linux
  brew install gcc
  ```
  To make sure that CGG works properly, run
  ```Linux
  gcc --version
  ```
  Next step, check for the python version with
  ```Linux
  python --version
  ```
  Python wrapper for class may not yet be compatible with Python version ¿
  3.11, so we have to specify version of Python in order to set up the wrapper. In
  this note we will use Python v.3.11. Next step, we need to install Cython. This
  allows Python code to directly call the C functions in CLASS. To install Cython
  that associate with the Python v.3.11, use the command below.
  ```Linux
  python3.11 -m pip install Cython
  ```


- Linux Users \
  You need to have `gcc` compiler `Python`, and `Cython`. To install `gcc` use the following commands,
  ```Linux
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt install gcc
  ```

  Almost every Linux distribution comes with a version of `Python` included in the default system packages, Check your `Python` version by using the following command;
  ```Linux
  python3 --version
  ```
  or
  ```Linux
  python --version
  ```
  
  In case you want a better handling of the `Python` packages download and install Miniconda or Anaconda from the following links;
  [Miniconde](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  Next to install `Cython`;
  ```Linux
  pip install Cython
  ```
  or
  ```Linux
  conda install Cython
  ```
### 2. Downloading CLASS
  Before getting CLASS, you may create a project directory using
  ```Linux
  mkdir <dirname> && cd $_
  ```
  Replace <dirname> with the name you prefer. After entering the <dirname>
directory, download the latest version of `CLASS` by downloading via git using
the command
  ```Linux
  git clone https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public.git
  ```
  We can also download `CLASS` directly from [Github](https://github.com/).

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d21381d5-8094-45aa-9bf0-5260ea5dd80f" height="500px"  width="1000px"   align="center" >
  </p>

### 3. Installing CLASS
  Enter `CLASS` directory. Compile Ccode and Pythonwrapper using the command.
  ```Linux
  PYTHON=python3.11 make all
  ```
  or
  ```Linux
  make -j
  ```
  If you have no multiple versions of Python. Execute the command.   
  ```Linux
  ./class explanatory.ini
  ```
  to test if the `C` code installed successfully. To test if the Python wrapper setup successfully, compile.
  ```Linux
  python3.11 -c "import classy; print(classy.__version__)"
  ```

### 4. Setting Python wrapper in a virtual environment
  Create a virtual environment (venv) using  
  ```Linux
  python3.11 -m venv <myenv>
  ```
  You can replace `<myenv>` with any name you want. Then activate the virtual
environment with  
```Linux
  source <myenv>/bin/activate
  ```
  To make sure that whenever the command python is compiled it point to the
correct version of Python as you included in the virtual environment, you can
place the function below in .bashrc or .zshrc for z-shell (if you don’t have
.bashrc or .zshrc, just create one).
  ```Linux
  function venv() {
    source "$1/bin/activate"  
    alias python="$1/bin/python"
    alias pip="$1/bin/pip"
  }
  ```
  Then restart the terminal. Activate the virtual environment again. Now you
can test if the command python points to the same version of Python using in
the virtual environment by compiling.
  ```Linux
  which python; which pip
  ```
  Or, check for the version of Python.
  ```Linux
  python --version; pip --version
  ```
  After that, install necessary modules to the environment, type.
  ```Linux
  pip install numpy scipy cython matplotlib
  ```
  In the `CLASS` directory, go to the ‘python’ directory and execute the command:
  ```Linux
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
  ```
  Checking if the steps above worked properly by compiling
  ```Linux
  python -c "import classy; print(classy.__version__)"
  ```
### 5.Using `CLASS` on Jupyter Notebook
  Firstly you have to install Jupyter Notebook.
  ```Linux
  pip install notebook
  ```
  To make sure that the path of Jupyter Notebook is in the created venv, type.
  ```Linux
  which jupyter
  ```
  If the Notebook is not in the right path, you may have follow this way:
  ```Linux
  pip install ipython ipykernel
  ```
  After installing `ipython` and `ipykernel`, run
  ```Linux
  ipython kernel install --user --name=<myvenv>
  ```
  and
  ```Linux
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<myvenv>
  ```
  Now the Jupyter Notebook should be in the right path. You can test it by
typing (you probably have to restart the shell, and activate the venv again).
  ```Linux
  which jupyter
  ```
  If all thing going fine, to use the Jupyter Notebook, run
  ```Linux
  jupyter notebook
  ```
### (Optional) Creating the alias for the virtual environment 
  You can create a command to activate the venv any directory by putting the
following command in the file `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. Firstly, open the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file by typing
  ```Linux
  vim ~/.bashrc
  ```
  or
  ```Linux
  vim ~/.zshrc
  ```
  (or you can use the text editor, nano, if you prefer). Then, put the command:
  ```Linux
  alias <your_prefer_name>="source $HOME/<path/to/myvenv>/bin/activate"
  ```
  Then, overwrite the file with `:wq` (in vim command mode), or `Ctr+O` (for nano).


Monte Python
==================
### 1. Getting Monte Python
  MontePython can be downloaded by
  ```Linux
  git clone https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public.git
  ```
  You need the Python program version 2.7.x** or version 3.x**. Your Python must have ‘numpy‘ (version >= 1.4.1) and ‘Cython’. The last one is used to wrap `CLASS` in `Python`. \
  Optional: If you want to use the plotting capabilities of Monte Python fully, you also need the ‘scipy’, with interpolate, and ‘matplotlib’ modules. \
  After installation, go to the directory:
  ```Linux
  cd montepython_public
  ```
  Make a copy of the file `default.conf.template` and rename it to `default.conf` (or any name your prefer)
  ```Linux
  cp default.conf.template default.conf
  ```
  At minimum, the file `default.cof` needs one line. \
  ⚠️ **You need to replace `<path/to/your/class_public>` by your `class_public` installed directory path.**
  ```Linux
  path['cosmo'] = '<path/to/your/class_public>'
  ```
  Make sure that your `CLASS` directory has the same name as in the path.
  Now the code is installed. There are two main (optional) commands in `MontePython`: the first one is run, for running MCMC to generate chains, another one is info, for analysing chains. More information can be viewed by executing
  ```Linux
  python montepython/MontePython.py --help
  python montepython/MontePython.py run --help
  python montepython/MontePython.py info --help
  ```
  To test a small running, executing:
  ```Linux
  path['cosmo'] = '<path/to/your/class_public>'
  ```
  ⚠️ **You need to replace `<path/to/your/class_public>` by your `class_public` installed directory path.** \
  To get running, type:
  ```Linux
  python montepython/MontePython.py run -o test -p input/example.param
  ```
  If the directory `test/` doesn’t exist, it will be created, and a run with the number of steps described in `example.param` will be started. To run a chain with more steps, one can type:
  ```Linux
  python montepython/MontePython.py run -o test -p input/example.param -N 100
  ```
  To analyse the chains, type
  ```Linux
  python montepython/MontePython.py info test/
  ```

Setting up Planck Likelihood
==================
  The Planck 2018 data can be found on the [Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#home). The Planck Likelihood Code (plc) is based on a library called `clik`. It will be extracted, alongside several `clik` folders that contain the likelihoods. The code uses an auto installer device, called `waf`. \
Here is the detail of the full installation.
  Next, create a directory which you want to store Planck data, and go into that directory \
  ⚠️ **You need to replace `<path/to/your/planck>` by your own name such as `planck`.**
  ```Linux
  mkdir -p <path/to/planck> && cd $_
  ```
  Download the code and baseline data (will need 300 Mb of space)
  ```Linux
  wget -O COM_Likelihood_Code-v3.0_R3.01.tar.gz "http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/aio/product-action?COSMOLOGY.FILE_ID=COM_Likelihood_Code-v3.0_R3.01.tar.gz"
  wget -O COM_Likelihood_Data-baseline_R3.00.tar.gz  "http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/aio/product-action?COSMOLOGY.FILE_ID=COM_Likelihood_Data-baseline_R3.00.tar.gz"
  ```
  Uncompress the code and the likelihood, and do some clean-up
  ```Linux
  tar -xvzf COM_Likelihood_Code-v3.0_R3.01.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf COM_Likelihood_Data-baseline_R3.00.tar.gz
  rm COM_Likelihood_*tar.gz
  ```
  Move into the code directory
  ```Linux
  cd code/plc_3.0/plc-3.01
  ```
  Configure the code. Note that you are **strongly advised** to configure clik with the Intel mkl library, and not with lapack. There is a massive gain in execution time: without it, the code is dominated by the execution of the low-l polarisation data. Before the next step, ensure you do NOT have any old Planck likelihoods sourced!
  ```Linux
  ./waf configure --lapack_mkl=${MKLROOT} --install_all_deps
  ```
  If everything goes well, you will be ready to install the code
  ```Linux
  ./waf install
  ```
  Next, source the likelihood. If you are running on a shell, type the command
  ```Linux
  source bin/clik_profile.sh
  ```
  ### For MacOS
  Running on a z-shell, you will first need to create a .zsh version of the above file. This can be done in many ways, for example
  ```Linux
  cp bin/clik_profile.sh bin/clik_profile.zsh
  sed -i 's/addvar PATH /PATH=$PATH:/g' bin/clik_profile.zsh
  sed -i 's/addvar PYTHONPATH /PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/g' bin/clik_profile.zsh
  sed -i 's/addvar LD_LIBRARY_PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/g' bin/clik_profile.zsh
  source bin/clik_profile.zsh
  ```
  You need to add
  ```Linux
  source </path/to/planck>/code/plc_3.0/plc-3.01/bin/clik_profile.sh
  ```
  ⚠️ **You need to replace `<path/to/your/planck>` by your own installed path.
  to your `.bashrc`, and you should put it in your scripts for cluster computing. \
  ### For Ubuntu
  Running on a bash-shell, you will first need to create a .sh version of the above file. This can be done in many ways, for example
  ```Linux
  cp bin/clik_profile.sh bin/clik_profile.sh
  sed -i 's/addvar PATH /PATH=$PATH:/g' bin/clik_profile.sh
  sed -i 's/addvar PYTHONPATH /PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/g' bin/clik_profile.sh
  sed -i 's/addvar LD_LIBRARY_PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/g' bin/clik_profile.sh
  source bin/clik_profile.sh
  ```
  You need to add
  ```Linux
  source </path/to/planck/>code/plc_3.0/plc-3.01/bin/clik_profile.sh
  ```
  to your `.shellrc` (or the `.zsh` to your `.zshrc` on a z-shell), and you should put it in your scripts for cluster computing. \
  After successfully installing Planck likelihoods, in MontePython configuration file, you will need to add
  ```Linux
  path['clik'] = '</path/to/planck/code/plc_3.0/plc-3.01>'
  ```
⚠️ **You need to replace `<path/to/your/planck/code/plc_3.0/plc-3.01>` by your own installed path.\
  There are nine Planck 2018 likelihoods defined in *Monte Python*: 'Planck_highl_TT', 'Planck_highl_TT_lite', 'Planck_highl_TTTEEE', 'Planck_highl_TTTEEE_lite', 'Planck_lensing', 'Planck_lowl_TT', 'Planck_lowl_EE', 'Planck_lowl_EEBB', 'Planck_lowl_BB', as well as five sets of parameter files, bestfit files, and covmats.
